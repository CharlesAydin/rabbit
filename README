Hopper Push Messaging API
-------------------------

Hopper uses AMQP messaging. We are using the open-source RabbitMQ implementation of AMQP internally and it has proven robust and scalable. You can find out more about RabbitMQ here (http://www.rabbitmq.com). For a good overview of various message queue implementations, you might be interested in this: http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Message_Queue_Evaluation_Notes.

For message serialization, we use ProtocolBuffers. You can find out more here: http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/. We have found it to be more flexible than basic Java object serialization, which is often problematic when transferring objects between different JRE implementations and versions. And it is much more IO-efficient than XML, which is important considering the message volume that we are dealing with. It also has the advantage of being language-agnostic.

We have generated Java classes for the ProtocolBuffer messages. We have also created an example Java class that demonstrates how to create a message and send it to an AMQP exchange.  If you use a programming language other than Java, we can help you generate the corresponding binding classes (although it should be trivial).

RabbitMQ Server
-------------------------
If you're interested in installing a RabbitMQ Server, the instructions for installing one are here: http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html. It is very simple and requires no schema configuration.  You can install it on a workstation or on a server -- simply change the hostname accordingly in the OTAExample class.

It is recommended that you install the rabbitmq-management plugins to administer and monitor the RabbitMQ server: http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html#rabbitmq-management.  Please see the RabbitMQ plugins page for information about installing plugins: http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html
